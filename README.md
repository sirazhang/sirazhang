ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sirazhang, a teacher and explorer in education. I'm passionate about gamification and computer-assisted learning, with a special focus on language teaching and second language acquisition.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm working on building the LLM in Education, aiming to train a better language assistant. I believe that technology can play a vital role in reducing education inequity.

ðŸ“– I'm also developing my website, memorize-wd.com, where I'm excited to incorporate more game elements and explore the possibilities of augmented reality (AR) in education.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at sirazhang@gmail.com. Additionally, you can check out my past business pitch video here: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01nLtyqzji0&t=15s).
